# music player
music player using datastructures and c++.

Developed a music player application in C++ using **doubly linked lists** for efficient playlist management and a **stack** to track recently played songs. The project includes features like adding, deleting, searching, sorting, and playing songs, along with **file handling** to store and retrieve playlists. This implementation demonstrates strong **data structures and algorithm (DSA) skills**, leveraging **linked lists for dynamic song management** and **stacks for playback history**.
